"""
Language analysis and the context-budget guard (leg 02 "language analysis",
leg 04 step 5).

Counts prompt tokens and trims prompts that would overflow a model's safe
``num_ctx``. ``num_ctx`` injection stops the *default* 32k cliff; the budget
guard is the backstop for a prompt that overflows even the safe ceiling.

This module previously carried a self-verification pass that rejected
first-person "I did the thing" claims with no tool-call evidence behind them.
It was removed: the check inferred intent from a regex over English, so a
correct turn that simply narrated its work was rerolled through every retry and
backend and then returned a 502. A validator that rejects correct output is
worse than no validator. The remaining checks in
:func:`app.resilience.validate_response` all key off structurally broken output.
The benchmark harness keeps a ``missed_toolcall`` rule
(``scripts/reliability_loop.py``), which is sound there because the harness
knows out-of-band that a tool call was required.

    The flagship ``num_ctx`` injection stops ollama's default 32k cliff, but a
    backend serving ``OLLAMA_NUM_PARALLEL > 1`` loads ``num_ctx`` as the model's
    *total* window and divides it across the parallel slots, so a single request's
    usable window is ``num_ctx / NUM_PARALLEL`` - the injected number silently
    halved (or worse) (issue #33). This is the exact silent-truncation failure the
    proxy exists to kill, pushed one layer down, so it must be surfaced loud.

    The signature is a ``prompt_eval_count`` that came back materially below *both*:

    * ``target_ctx`` - the per-request window the proxy asked each slot to deliver
      (the derived ``num_ctx``), and
    * ``prompt_tokens_sent`` - the proxy's own token count of the prompt it sent.

    The first says the delivered window fell short of the ask; the second says the
    prompt had more to show than the backend processed (so the shortfall is real
    truncation, not just a small prompt that fit). ``tolerance`` is the slack that
    absorbs tokenizer drift between the proxy's tiktoken estimate and ollama's real
    count, so a prompt that merely filled its window is never mistaken for a clip -
    the NUM_PARALLEL division produces a ~50% shortfall, far past any drift.

    Returns ``False`` when there is no signal to judge (``prompt_eval_count`` of 0,
