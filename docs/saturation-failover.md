# Saturation failover

Part of [proxy.md](proxy.md).

## A saturated backend is not a failed backend

Issue #108, on the 2026-08-12 Echo outage, in Kai's words: "echo failed its
turns b/c I had a game running on the 3026 and aproxy doesn't know how to
communicate that limitation / state".

A game on the local GPU host starved local inference. Echo failed **100% of
turns for ~2.5 hours** at ~180s each while Deep answered `ping` in 2.18s through
the same proxy. A resource conflict the proxy could not see, route around, or
describe.

Two independent gaps, either one sufficient. **Health is not capacity**: `GET
/api/tags` returns 200 in 6.7ms while the GPU is fully occupied, which says the
model is installed, not that inference can proceed now. And **a hang is not an
error**: the resilience machinery fires on validation failures, 500s, and
refused connections, and a saturated backend produces none of those. It accepts
the request and goes quiet, and the proxy waited until the caller's deadline
killed it.

Slowness was not a failure condition. For a self-hosted GPU tier sharing
hardware with a human, it is the *primary* one.

## What changed

`PROXY_BACKEND_SLOW_AFTER` is the seconds an attempt may run before its backend
counts as saturated. `0` disables it, which is the default. Past it the attempt is abandoned, the chain **advances to the next tier** rather
than retrying the same backend, and the backend's circuit breaker records a
failure so subsequent requests skip it for the cooldown. A backend nobody can
get a token out of is unavailable, whatever it says about itself. This is what
makes the cloud failover in `coilyco-gaming/sirens-echo#81` reachable: it could
not help before, because from the proxy's point of view nothing had failed yet.

## Only the wait is bounded

On the streaming path the threshold bounds **time to the first chunk**. A stream
that has started is making progress, and cutting it for being long would be the
opposite of what the issue asks for. On the non-streaming path there is no
first-token signal to observe, so it bounds the whole attempt: set it above the
slowest legitimate completion on that route, or a long answer will be mistaken
for a stalled one.

## Deadline versus saturation

Different facts, and the caller is told which. When the request's own budget
(`PROXY_REQUEST_DEADLINE`, [request-deadline.md](request-deadline.md)) ran out,
the answer is `504 request_deadline_exceeded` and no failover happens, because
there is no time left to fail over into. When the budget survives and only this
backend was slow, the chain advances silently unless every tier is saturated.

## Saying so

A streaming caller receives an SSE comment as it happens, which is the literal
content of "aproxy doesn't know how to communicate that limitation / state".
See [sse-heartbeats.md](sse-heartbeats.md).

```
: {"state":"backend_saturated","backend":"tower-3026","failing_over":true}
```

The attempt span carries `agentproxy.outcome=saturated` and
`agentproxy.backend.regime=saturated`, the counter is
`llm_backend_saturated_total{logical_model,backend}`, and the log event is
`dispatch.backend_saturated`.

## What this does not do

It reacts rather than prevents. Option 3 in #108, capacity derived from GPU
utilisation, would stop the request being sent at all; its operator-supplied
half is the `regime` field in [backend-regime.md](backend-regime.md) and the
automatic half is open. Nothing here probes capacity either: `/api/tags` still
reports presence, and replacing it with a tiny real completion is option 1.
